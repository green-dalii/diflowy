Dear Diflowy Users,

Christmas is just around the corner, and we wanted to take a moment to say a big "Thank you!" to all of you who have supported Diflowy. Your trust and feedback mean the world to us, and we couldn't have come this far without your help.

To show our gratitude, we‚Äôre excited to offer a special Christmas gift to all of you‚Äî**a free three-month subscription to the TEAM plan**! From now until March 25, 2025, every user will automatically receive a three-month TEAM membership, unlocking advanced features and enhanced team collaboration.

We hope this little gift brings a smile to your holiday season and we look forward to continuing our journey together in the new year, building an even better Diflowy.

Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year! üéÑüéÅ

The Diflowy Team
